    <h1>Article 1:The Future of Digital Media in a Connected World</h1>
    <p>Digital media has rapidly transformed how
         people access information, entertainment, and news. With the rise of high-speed internet and smart devices, audiences now expect instant updates and personalized content. Traditional media—such as newspapers and television—has shifted to online platforms where interactive storytelling, real-time reporting, and multimedia presentations dominate.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) now plays a vital role in content creation. Newsrooms use AI tools 
to draft headlines, summarize long reports, and analyze trending topics. Automation allows journalists to focus more on investigative stories while AI handles repetitive tasks. Social media platforms also influence how audiences 
consume news, as articles are customized based on user behavior and interests.

The future of digital media is expected to become even more immersive. Technologies like augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and 3D visuals will allow readers to experience stories instead of simply reading them. As global connectivity grows, digital media will continue evolving into a highly interactive, intelligent, and user-centric ecosystem.</p>

    <h1>Article 2: Two forgotten kingdoms of Bengal</h1>
   <p>Maps are regarded as affirmative visual documents,
     permanently fixing places, distances, and itineraries in our minds. 
     Yet we often forget that early modern maps were subjective texts, only approximating places.
      Moreover, European mapmakers frequently chose to assign names to locations that bore little relation to their actual identities or physical positions. 
      This essay examines two such cases in Bengal: the kingdoms of Chandecan and Codovascam, located in what were once Samatata and Harikela.
Pratapaditya Roy (b. 1561 – d. 1611–12) 
envisioned a maritime polity that held together the port-based kingdom known as the Regno de Chandecan. Initially, Pratapaditya ruled the landlocked territory of Jessore, 
establishing his capital at Dhumghat — a strategic point at the confluence of the Jamuna (Brahmaputra) and Ichhamati rivers. The capital was later shifted south to Ishwaripur, also known as Jashoreshwaripur, 
on the Ichhamati in Khulna, with direct access to the Bay of Bengal. This site became the capital of the chiefdom from 1590 to 1612, 
featuring extensive shipyards and dockyards at Jahajghata or Khanpur, and also at Dadkhah and Chakvasi.</p>
